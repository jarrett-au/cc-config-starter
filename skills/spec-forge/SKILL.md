description: Create detailed specification documents through iterative interviews. Use when user asks to create a spec/PRD/design doc for a feature or system, provides requirements or instructions and asks to interview or explore in detail, starts planning phase before implementation when requirements need clarification and documentation, or designs complex features requiring analysis of technical implementation, UI/UX, concerns, and tradeoffs. The skill conducts deep, non-obvious interviews to uncover hidden complexity and writes comprehensive markdown specs.

# Spec Forge

Transforms high-level requirements into detailed specification documents through iterative interviewing using the `AskUserQuestionTool`. Spec Forge conducts in-depth interviews about technical implementation, UI/UX design, concerns, and tradeoffs—then writes comprehensive markdown specification documents.

## When to Use

Use Spec Forge when:
- User asks to create a spec, PRD, or design document
- User provides a file/instruction and requests detailed interviewing
- Starting planning phase before implementation
- Designing complex features requiring deep analysis

**Critical:** Only use when explicitly asked to create a spec or interview about requirements. Do not use for simple clarification questions or quick implementation tasks.

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Input First

Before asking any questions, thoroughly read and understand the provided context:
- If user provided a file: Read it completely
- If user provided instructions: Understand the full scope
- Identify what's already clear vs. what needs exploration

### 2. Begin Interviewing

Start with high-level questions, then iteratively drill deeper based on answers. Use **multiple rounds** of questioning—each round should go deeper based on previous responses.

**Interview principles:**

- **Avoid obvious questions** - Don't ask what you can reasonably infer or assume
- **Challenge assumptions** - Explore edge cases, failure modes, what could go wrong
- **Probe for hidden complexity** - Dig into technical implications of stated requirements
- **Explore tradeoffs** - Ask about alternatives and why certain approaches are preferred

**Question examples:**

- Instead of "What should the button do?", ask "What happens if the user clicks while the operation is still in progress?"
- Instead of "Should we use SQL or NoSQL?", ask "This data seems relational—have you considered eventual consistency requirements that might push you toward NoSQL?"
- Instead of "What's the success criteria?", ask "How will you know this is working 6 months from now? What metrics would indicate failure?"

**Continue interviewing** until you have sufficient information to write a comprehensive spec. Use your judgment—when you understand requirements, technical design, tradeoffs, and success criteria, you're ready to proceed.

**Final check before writing:** Present a brief summary of understanding and ask: "I have enough to write the spec. Shall I proceed, or is there more you'd like to add?"

### 3. Write Specification Document

Write the spec to a file and present a summary to the user. Use markdown format with these sections (adapt based on context):

**Standard sections:**
- **Problem & Motivation** - What problem are we solving, for whom, and why now
- **Requirements** - Functional requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
- **Technical Design** - System architecture, data models, APIs, technology choices
- **Success Criteria** - Success metrics, KPIs, how to measure if it works

**Additional sections as needed:**
- User flows / UX considerations (for UI-heavy features)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- Open questions / Decisions pending
- Alternatives considered and why they were rejected
- Implementation phases or milestones

**File location:** Ask user where to save the spec, or suggest a sensible default (e.g., `docs/specs/[feature-name].md` or `SPEC.md`)

**Delivery:** After writing the file, present a brief summary in chat highlighting:
- Problem being solved
- Key technical decisions
- Major tradeoffs discussed
- Any open questions remaining

## Interview Guidelines

### Good Questions vs. Bad Questions

**Bad (obvious):**
- "What should this feature do?"
- "Who are the users?"
- "Should we add error handling?"

**Good (non-obvious):**
- "What happens when two users edit this resource simultaneously?"
- "The requirements mention X—but what about Y edge case?"
- "You chose approach A. Have you considered B? Here's why B might be better..."
- "What's the failure mode if this dependency goes down?"

### Iterative Deep-Dive Pattern

**Round 1 - High-level understanding:**
- Core problem and users
- Main requirements and constraints
- Success vision

**Round 2 - Technical depth:**
- Architecture implications
- Data flows and state management
- Integration points and dependencies
- Performance/security concerns

**Round 3 - Edge cases and tradeoffs:**
- Failure scenarios and error handling
- Scalability considerations
- Alternative approaches and why rejected
- Long-term maintainability

Continue rounds as needed based on complexity.

### When to Stop Interviewing

**Ready to write when you have:**
- Clear problem statement and motivation
- Complete functional requirements
- Coherent technical approach
- Awareness of major tradeoffs and risks
- Defined success criteria
- Understanding of edge cases and failure modes

**If stuck or uncertain:** Ask user focused questions about the specific area that's unclear. Don't guess—ask.

## Output Format Guidelines

### Document Structure

Use clear, hierarchical markdown structure:

```markdown
# [Feature/System] Specification

## Problem & Motivation
[Why are we doing this? What problem does it solve?]

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

### User Stories
- As a [user type], I want [action] so that [benefit]

### Acceptance Criteria
- [Criteria 1]
- [Criteria 2]

## Technical Design
### Architecture
[System overview, components, interactions]

### Data Model
[Entities, relationships, key fields]

### API Endpoints (if applicable)
- [Method] [Path] - [Description]
  - Request: [schema]
  - Response: [schema]

### Technology Choices
- [Technology]: [Justification]

## Success Criteria
- [Metric 1]: [Target/Definition]
- [Metric 2]: [Target/Definition]

## [Additional sections as needed]
```

### Writing Style

- **Use present tense** - "The system validates..." not "The system will validate..."
- **Be specific** - Provide concrete examples, not vague descriptions
- **Include diagrams** - Use ASCII art or mermaid diagrams for architecture/flows when helpful
- **Cite tradeoffs** - Document why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives
- **Think long-term** - Consider maintenance, scalability, and evolution

### Quality Checklist

- [ ] Requirements are complete and unambiguous
- [ ] Technical design is coherent and justified
- [ ] Edge cases and failure modes are addressed
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
